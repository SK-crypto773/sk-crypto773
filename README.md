## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

# About Me
My name is Srikar Kusumanchi. I am a self-taught programmer and I have gained knowledge in 7 languages: Python, C, SQL, Shell, JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. I like to create programs that are innovative and can be used for later purposes. I have a deep passion for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Robotics. I am currently looking for an internship/part-time job that can help reinforce my knowledge of programming and be a good asset towards my college application.
